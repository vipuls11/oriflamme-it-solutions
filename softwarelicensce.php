            <h2 class="leading-8 font-semibold my-5">Understanding software licenses</h2>
            <p class="leading-8 text-justify">Simplify your software licensing agreements with oriflamme IT Solutions. Our platform offers a seamless experience for both software vendors and users, ensuring compliance and reducing confusion. Choose from proprietary or open-source licenses to fit your needs and let us handle the rest.</p> <br>
            <p class="leading-8 text-justify">Software licenses are legal agreements between software vendors and users that dictate how the software can be used. These licenses define the terms and conditions under which the software can be used, including the number of users, the duration of the license, and any limitations or restrictions on the software's use.</p> <br>
            <p class="leading-8 text-justify">There are two main types of software licenses: proprietary and open source. Proprietary software licenses are owned by the software vendor and are typically more restrictive in terms of usage rights, whereas open-source licenses allow users to modify and distribute the software freely.</p> <br>
            <p class="leading-8 text-justify">It's important to understand the terms and conditions of a software license before agreeing to it, as violating the terms of the license can result in legal and financial consequences. For example, if you exceed the number of authorized users or use the software beyond the terms of the license, you could be liable for copyright infringement.</p>

            <p class="leading-8 text-justify my-5">There are several different types of software license, each with its own set of terms and conditions. Some of the most common types of software license include :</p>

                <h2 class="text-center text-lg font-semibold capitalize my-2 text-red-600">Perpetual licenses</h2>
                <p class="leading-8 text-justify text-white text-sm px-4 py-2">Perpetual licenses are one-time purchases that allow users to use the software indefinitely. These licenses typically come with a one-time fee, which gives the user the right to install and use the software on a specified number of devices or for a specified number of users.</p>

                <p class="leading-8 text-justify text-white text-sm px-4 py-2">Subscription licenses allow users to use the software for a set period of time, typically monthly or annually. These licenses require users to pay a recurring fee for access to the software and may include additional services such as support or updates.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center text-lg font-semibold capitalize my-2 text-red-600">Concurrent licenses</h2>
                <p class="leading-8 text-justify text-white text-sm px-4 py-2">Concurrent licenses allow multiple users to access the software simultaneously, up to a specified number of users. These licenses are often used in multi-user environments, such as offices or classrooms.</p>
