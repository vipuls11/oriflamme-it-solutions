The Cyber Essentials and Cyber Essentials Plus certificates for cybersecurity are the two versions available. With a Plus certification, a company can demonstrate that it uses cutting-edge cyber security tools and has successfully completed further external testing. Go Live ORIFLAMME may evaluate, enhance, and certify your company's cyber security solutions in accordance with the Cyber Essentials standards in its capacity as a Cyber Essentials Certifying Body.</p><br>

           <p class="leading-8 text-justify ">Your company can enter into contracts with councils and governmental organizations by putting Cyber Essentials in place. Most professional bodies, including the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, now have Cyber Essentials as a minimal requirement.</p> <br>
